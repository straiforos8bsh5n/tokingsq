## [Overview][oview]

Heptio Sonobuoy is a diagnostic tool that makes it easier to understand the
state of a Kubernetes cluster by running a set of [Kubernetes][k8s] conformance
tests in an accessible and non-destructive manner. It is a customizable,
extendable, and cluster-agnostic way to generate clear, informative reports
about your cluster.

Its selective data dumps of Kubernetes resource objects and cluster nodes allow
for the following use cases:

* Integrated end-to-end (e2e) [conformance-testing][e2e]
* Workload debugging
* Custom data collection via extensible plugins

Sonobuoy supports Kubernetes versions 1.10, 1.11 and 1.12.

## More information

[The documentation][docs] provides further information about the conformance
tests, plugins, etc.

[docs]: https://github.com/heptio/sonobuoy/tree/master/docs

## Prerequisites

* Access to an up-and-running Kubernetes cluster. If you do not have a cluster,
  we recommend following the [AWS Quickstart for Kubernetes][quickstart] instructions.

[quickstart]: https://aws.amazon.com/quickstart/architecture/heptio-kubernetes/

* `kubectl` installed. See [installing via Homebrew (MacOS)][brew] or [building
  the binary (Linux)][linux].

* An admin `kubeconfig` file, and the KUBECONFIG environment variable set.

## Getting Started

The browser-based [Sonobuoy Scanner tool][scanner] is the quickest way to get
started with Sonobuoy. Sonobuoy Scanner also provides a user-friendly way of
viewing your scan results.

**NOTE:** Sonobuoy Scanner runs conformance tests only.

## Using the CLI

Sonobuoy also provides a CLI that lets you run Sonobuoy on your cluster. By default, the CLI
records the following results:

* Information about your cluster's hosts, Kubernetes resources, and versions.
* systemd logs from each host. Requires a plugin.
* The results of a e2e conformance tests.

### CLI Prerequisites

* Golang installed. We recommend [gimme][gimme], with golang version 1.10.4.

* Your $PATH configured:

```
$ export PATH=$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin:$PATH 
```

### Download and run

Download the CLI by running:

```
$ go get -u -v github.com/heptio/sonobuoy
```

Deploy a Sonobuoy pod to your cluster with:

```
$ sonobuoy run
```

View actively running pods:

```
$ sonobuoy status 
```

To inspect the logs:

```
$ sonobuoy logs
```

To view the output, copy the output directory from the main Sonobuoy pod to
somewhere local:

```
$ sonobuoy retrieve .
```

This copies a single `.tar.gz` snapshot from the Sonobuoy pod into your local
`.` directory. Extract the contents into `./results` with:

```
mkdir ./results; tar xzf *.tar.gz -C ./results
```

For information on the contents of the snapshot, see the [snapshot
documentation][snapshot].

[snapshot]: docs/snapshot.md

### Cleanup

To clean up Kubernetes objects created by Sonobuoy, run:

```
sonobuoy delete
```

### Run on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Note that if you run Sonobuoy on a Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster, you
must first create an admin role for the user under which you run Sonobuoy:

```
kubectl create clusterrolebinding <your-user-cluster-admin-binding> --clusterrole=cluster-admin --user=<your.google.cloud.email@example.org>
```
