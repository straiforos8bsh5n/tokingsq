WebAssembly support is ever evolving. Right now it is supported by the following languages:

C / C++ - has very good (production ready) support via EmScripten, or other minimal LLVM-based toolchains
Rust - WebAssembly is an officially supported target, with a highly active community around it.
Go - has now supports WebAssembly as an official, yet experimental, target
C# - has experimental support via Blazor, however this currently requires embedding a .NET runtime into Wasm. Blazor was officially adopted by Microsoft as an experimental technology, with a recent preview release.
D - the "betterC" subset of D can be compiled to WebAssembly through LDC (LLVM compiler).

TypeScript - via AssemblyScript, highly experimental, but gaining momentum.

Java - via TeaVM or Bytecoder

Haxe - just announced support
Kotlin - Kotlin/Native 0.4 gained experimental support of WebAssembly and via TeaVM
Python - Pyodide is a port of Python to WebAssembly that includes the core packages of the scientific Python stack (Numpy, Pandas, matplotlib).
PHP - Experimental, but with a working prototype

Perl - WebPerl is a port of the Perl binary to WebAssembly, allowing you to run Perl scripts on the web.

Scala - using the Emscripten compiler
Ruby - via the run.rb project
Swift - using SwiftWasm, which is currently under development
There are commercial solutions also:

RemObjects - Which has announced support for C#, Java, Swift and Oxygene

WASM 的框架 / 库的选择已经比较丰富了，如：C# + Blazor、Go + Vugu、Rust + Yew 等等
Blazor正式成为Microsoft官方.NET 和WebAssembly项目
