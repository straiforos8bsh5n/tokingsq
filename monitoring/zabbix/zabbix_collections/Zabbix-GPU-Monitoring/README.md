# Zabbix-GPU-Monitoring
Monitoring your AMD/Nvidia GPUs with Zabbix

Also going to have zabbix restart TPLink HS100 or HS110 smart plug! So when your load drops it will restart the box.



## Disclaimer
I put this together for myself mainly, but if others find what I have found useful then rejoice!  I wasn't able to really find any good info on Monitoring AMD cards so I pseudo created it. Nvidia was a bit more friendly.. But I wanted them all in one easy to find area.
