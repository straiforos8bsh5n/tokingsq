Zabbix Extensions that extends Zabbix monitoring facilities.

**Unfortunately, these scripts aren't supported. I don't work with zabbix and I can't develop new features or fix issues. 
All existing issues are suspended, but if you have pull-requests I will accept them.**

Features:

- written in Bash (requires minimal dependencies);
- in some cases may needs utilities for working directly with the applications (redis-cli, hpacucli, psql, etc...).
- extensions tested, but proper work isn't guaranteed (when a mismatch between software version);
