**What did you try to do?**

Please include the steps you took, including the commands you ran in your terminal.

(If you can simplify this or provide a link to a small public repository that demonstrates the bug, that would be extremely helpful.)

**What happened?**

(Please include the full text of any error messages.)

**What did you hope to happen?**

**Does `./test-image` work?**

If you check out the repository on a Mac or Linux system and run `./build-image`, does it succeed or fail? This will build several known-good examples from the `rust-musl-builder/examples` directory.

**Additional information**

Is there anything else that we should know?
