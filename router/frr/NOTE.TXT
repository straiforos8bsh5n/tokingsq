Installing FRRouting (FRR) on your CentOS KVM/Libvirt host and setting up BGP

Introduction
so I had this idea when looking at FRRouting. as its a linux package, you can install it on a box running KVM/Libvirt, then you can enable BGP and redistribute the connected networks. This makes spining up new virtual networks on the hypervisor very easy as you do not need to rely on static routes and as soon as you spin up a new virtual network its adveristing to the rest of your network.

what is FRRouting (FRR)
FRRouting (FRR) is a fork of Quagga. its used in Cumulus networks OS as the routing suite.

This guide is based on a install of CentOS 7.5

Step 1 Install FRR
Install the latest FRR rpm from https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/releases
yum install -y https://github.com/FRRouting/frr/releases/download/frr-5.0.1/frr-5.0.1-2018070501.el7.centos.x86_64.rpm

Edit the daemons file and change the routing protocols you want from no to yes (you must always enable zebra) in this case zebra and bgpd
vi /etc/frr/daemons

zebra=yes
bgpd=yes

Start FRR and set to start on boot
systemctl enable frr && systemctl start frr

Check status of frr - should show as active (running)
systemctl status frr

Step 2 configure FRR and BGP
open the frr shell by typing the command
vtysh

Enter cofiguration mode

conf t

This step is optional this command command puts all the frr config into one file
service integrated-vtysh-config

configure BGP on the KVM host

I am configuring a route-map used to prevent some routes from being redistributed also will tag a bgp community for all the permitted routes you do not need to do this but it gives you more control and tagging the route helps with visibility.

ip prefix-list PL_BGP_DENY_CONNECTED seq 5 permit 10.25.10.0/24

route-map RM_BGP_REDISTRIBUTED_CONNECTED deny 10
match ip address prefix-list PL_BGP_DENY_CONNECTED

route-map RM_BGP_REDISTRIBUTED_CONNECTED permit 9999
set community 65010:10100

Here we are configuring the BGP process AS/router id/tuning the timers from there defualt to 2/6 and configuring the neighour

router bgp 65010
bgp router-id 10.25.10.100
bgp log-neighbor-changes
timers bgp 2 6
neighbor 10.25.10.1 remote-as 65000

now to configure the redistribute connected command and set the route map we have created

address-family ipv4 unicast
redistribute connected route-map RM_BGP_REDISTRIBUTED_CONNECTED
exit-address-family

Exit and save configuration

end

write

Step 3 Verify bgp is up and that we have routes
Here we can see that the bgp session is up

Below we can see that have two connected virtual networks in bgp and are receiving a default route from the router we are connected to.
