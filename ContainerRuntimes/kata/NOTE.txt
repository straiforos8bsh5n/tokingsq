Kata Containers is an officially supported CRI-O and Containerd CRI Plugin runtime. It is OCI compatible and therefore aligns with project's architecture and requirements. However, due to the fact that Kubernetes execution units are sets of containers (also known as pods) rather than single containers, the Kata Containers runtime needs to get extra information to seamlessly integrate with Kubernetes.
