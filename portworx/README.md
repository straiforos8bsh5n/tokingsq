# PX-Developer 1.2.11

PX-Developer (PX-Dev) is scale-out storage and data services for containers.  PX-Dev itself is deployed as a container with your application stack.  By running PX-Dev with your application stack, you get container-granular controls for storage persistence, capacity management, performance, and availability in a scaleout environment. Deploying the PX-Developer container on a server with Docker Engine turns that server into a scale-out storage node. Storage runs converged with compute and gives bare-metal drive performance. PX-Dev can be used alongside [Kubernetes](https://portworx.com/use-case/kubernetes-storage/), [DC/OS](https://portworx.com/use-case/persistent-storage-dcos/) and [Docker](https://portworx.com/use-case/docker-persistent-storage/) to provide persistent storage for containerized applications.

PX-Dev offers container granular services such as:

1. Data persistence in a multi node environment
2. Synchronous data availability across multiple availability zones and automatic AZ detection
3. Automatic tiering and class of service enforcement
4. Bring-your-own-key Encryption
5. Shared namespaces across containers running on different servers
6. S3 interfaces and backup to S3
7. Integration with schedulers to automate container placement
