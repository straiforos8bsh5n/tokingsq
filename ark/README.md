## Overview

Ark gives you tools to back up and restore your Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. Ark lets you:

* Take backups of your cluster and restore in case of loss.
* Copy cluster resources to other clusters.
* Replicate your production environment for development and testing environments.

Ark consists of:

* A server that runs on your cluster
* A command-line client that runs locally

You can run Ark in clusters on a cloud provider or on-premises. For detailed information, see [Compatible Storage Providers][99].

## More information

[The documentation][29] provides a getting started guide, plus information about building from source, architecture, extending Ark, and more.
